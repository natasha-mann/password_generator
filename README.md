## About the Project

The aim of this project was to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript.

### How I met the brief

- Added a user prompt for the length of the password, which is then stored as a variable.
- Added a validation to check that the password length meets pre-specified criteria (between 8 and 128 characters).
- Added user prompt to confirm which of four character types they wish to include in the password and results are stored in variables.
- Added validation to check if at least one character type has been selected.
- If either of the above validations fail, user is alerted with an error message.
- Added a function to add characters of selected arrays into a combined array.
- Added a function which takes a random character from the combined array and then loops through this for the password length and pushes the random characters into a new password array.
- Joined the password array into a string to be displayed on the user's screen.
