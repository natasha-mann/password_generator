## Description

The aim of this project was to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript.

The completed app contains the following elements:

- User is prompted to input the required password length.
- User is asked to confirm which of four character types they wish to include in the password.
- If the suggested password length doesn't meet the pre-specified criteria, and if at least one of the character types is not selected, the user receives an alert with an error message, and the programme exits.
- Taking into account the user's choices for length and character type, the programme then randomly generates a password.
- The password is printed to the screen.
